# Perec

Perec is an evolving modification of the [pelican-svbhack](https://github.com/giulivo/pelican-svbhack) theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) with influences from [uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/uno) which was written for [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org). 

It was built on the fly and is still rather rough in some areas.

You are welcome to look at my mess; however, this not production ready.

## DEMO Site

You can view the theme at [Text and Hubris](http://www.textandhubris.com/).
